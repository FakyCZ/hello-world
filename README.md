# Hello-World
My first GitHub project and also my first project at all. I am here to learn faster and get inspiration.
Ok, i just hope i am fast learner. We will see. For now i am happy with discovering of different programming languages and i am finding my way in coding world. IÂ´d like to learn how to make interesting apps and webpages. I am on right place i guess. 

See you around,
